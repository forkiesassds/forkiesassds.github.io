The website has recived some updates!

<!--more-->

I decided to add a blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), this allows me to add new content without writing any HTML code. 
And this also allows me to do stuff that wasn't possible with pure HTML such as make pages using Markdown without using JS.

I hope you enjoy this new update.

NOTE: I need examples of awful modern website practices such as mobile first design. You can send me them [here](https://github.com/forkiesassds/forkiesassds.github.io/issues).
