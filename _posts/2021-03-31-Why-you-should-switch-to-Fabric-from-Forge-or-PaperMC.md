This is why you should switch to Fabric from Forge or PaperMC

<!--more-->

##Why switch from Forge
Forge is a bloated mess, maintainers are just not so friendly, requires a lot of system resources and is just old.

##Why switch from PaperMC
The mascot, WHY IN THE HOLY FUCK WAS IT MADE? ONLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE MAKE MASCOTS FOR SOFTWARE, AND WHY IN THE HOLY FUCK DID THEY MAKE THE MASCOT A FUCKING ANIME CHARACTER HFHGJGFHJGHJKHGVJK
WHY WASTE ALL OF THE POTENTIAL DEVELOPEMENT TIME ON A GOD DAMN ANIME MASCOT OF ALL FUCKING THINGS.

If you want to see why I have rage against this just look [here](https://github.com/PaperMC/papermc.io/commit/2bae261a8bc1d9336722c335ff1d5432cc06d175).
