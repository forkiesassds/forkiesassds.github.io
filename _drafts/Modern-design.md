Modern design just sometimes don't make sense to me.

<!--more-->

Modern website designs were first desinged for mobile phones of all things, and thus causes designs with large elements and wasted screen space.
And sometimes some of these designs have a lot of whitespace such as GitHub.

Looks nice, doesn't it? Now how about you see the same site on a 16:9 screen.

As you might see I have pointed out some flaws, such as a lot of whitespace... Whitespace gets even worse once you get an even wider screen like 21:9 or 32:9


Here is another example of the many awful mobile first websites.

![YouTube homepage](/assets/youtube_homepage.png)

The YouTube homepage looks huge due to the large thumbnails, which are a result from awful mobile first practices. 
And do you think most computer users have a touch screen? Probably not. 

Also the homepage only shows 4 videos per row, and no, more videos don't show up on wider screens, it just adds more whitespace...

## Websites being annoying
![YouTube nagging me to sign in](/assets/youtube_nag.png)

YouTube nags me to sign into my Google account.
This prompt used to be a hint that tells you that you are not logged in, later got turnned into a nagging dialog telling you to sign in...

Like come on, please stop shoving the log in dialog every time I use an incog window.

![YouTube tells me that it uses cookies](/assets/youtube_cookies.png)

YouTube also tells me that it uses cookies.
This dialog used to be a banner on the top of the page, and then they turned it into an annoying dialog. It is also sometimes broken in that it takes forever for it to load up.

Like also come on, just tell me that the site uses cookies instead of shoving that infront of me.

## Unhelpful for the user
![A generic error message](/assets/generic_error.png)

Unhelpful error messages are the worst, they just say "An error occured, please try again." without any debug info or error code.
Usually they hide the error somewhere or just even not say what error is it.
